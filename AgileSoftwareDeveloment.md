## Agile software development

Agile software development advocates planning, evolutionary development, early delivery and continuous improvement and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
	It is based on principles in which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self organizing and cross functional teams

### Agile manifesto
Individuals and interactions over process and tools.
Working software over detailed documentation.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
Responding to change over following a plan.

### Principles of Agile software development

 - Customer satisfaction 
 - Welcome changing requirements 
 - Working software is delivered frequently and is the measure of progress. 
 - Close and daily cooperation between business and developer team. 
 - Projects are built around motivated individuals. Effective communication
- Efficient and effective method of conveying information.
- Sustainable development ,able to maintain a constant pace.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and gooddesign.
- Avoid unnecessary and redundant work.
- Best software emerge from self organizing teams debating over it.
- Take regular feedback and improve over it.

## Srum

A framework used to address complex adaptive problems and deliver products of highest value productively.

### Srum Team

**Product Owner** 
	Product owner maintains the backlog of the product. Details the backlog items and prioritizes them. The goal is to maximize product  value and development team productivity.
**Development team**
	Self organizing and cross functional responsible for delivering product increments after each sprint
**Scrum Master**
	Ensures best practices are applied and removes obstacles for quality product delivery

### The Sprint
![Scrum Development environment](https://github.com/sandeepamilineni/DeveloperNotes/blob/master/images/scrum.PNG "Scrum")

**Time-boxed** implementation spanning typically 2 to 4 weeks and no changes are made to sprint scope
**Artifacts** - Product catalog, Sprint backlog, Increment
**Events** - Sprint planning, Daily scrum, Sprint review, Sprint retrospective.

**Product Backlog** - All the features needed to implement fro the product. Priorities of the features are managed by Product Owner. Its never complete, its updated by feedback from different stakeholders by hypothesis  , ideas and needs of the product
**Sprint Backlog** - features selected to be delivered in a sprint . The developer estimates effort for the feature.
**Increment** - Product backlog items completed during the given sprint
**Sprint planning** - Its the start of a sprint ,plans the scope, features going in . The development team works on the Sprint Backlog


## Kanban
Balances the demand with the capacity to take new work.
Work items are visualized are Kanban Board to give a view of progress and process of workflow mapped.

### Kanban principles

**JIT** - Just in Time<br>
We focus on just what is needed and when and amount needed. It eliminates waste, distractions and redundant work. The work is not pushed it pulled from backlog after the work item is Done.
**WIP** - Work in progress<br>
Must be limited and match development capacity.
Kanban Board - Is used to visualization of progress and process.
**Comparison**<br>
Srum is fixed length or timeboxed , kanban is continuous in nature whether its implementation or delivery timeline.
